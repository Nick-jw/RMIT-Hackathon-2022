# Hackathon project
This was developed during the 2 day RMIT Activator Hackathon
Project by Nicholas Waterson, James Ogilvie, Ben Westphal and Kai Gibson.



### Development process
The development of this project was stimulated by the prompt of 
"Increasing gender diversity in software development positions".

Our response to this prompt is a website similar to Glassdoor.
TurnOver displays information submitted by employees about the culture of a workplace, including gender diversity and acceptance based on categorical critera.

It is designed to allow individuals to guage a workplace's culture and suitability, while also incentivising workplaces to provide and uphold a healthy culture.

The full design document is unavailable, but a draft document of the website design can be found here:

### Implementation
The website is built in Python with the Django framework. 
Django includes an integrated database defined in models.py.
HTML pages are found in '/templates', with control logic in views.py
